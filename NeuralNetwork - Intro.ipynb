    "\n",
    "If not, we are most likely over-fitting the data, i.e. we get a NN that brilliantly fits the training points, but utterly fails in validation. This is analogous to fitting a bunch of linearly correlated $\\left(x,y\\right)$ points with a 1000-degree polynomial. The fit might go through all the points, but it has no predictive power!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we would like to train the NN to be as accurate <b>and</b> simple as possible, and one way to simplify a NN with lots of neurons is setting some useless connections to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of the network $R$, or regularisation factor, can be estimated e.g. by the sum of squared parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = \\sum_{i} \\omega_i^2$$\n",
